            <p>
                This group is comprised of all students in Chorale, Advanced Women, and Choraliers. While Concert Choir does not have a designated class time, the
                three groups comprising it will learn certain pieces in each of their respective classes and then come together to perform them. Concert Choir has MANDATORY rehearsals after school at least once per week. Participation in extra curricular festivals is expected, and repertoire will be more difficult.
