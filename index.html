                This website was designed to assist you and your family to stay as
                informed and up-to-date with this yearâ€™s choir activities as possible. By using this
                website, it is our hope to keep you apprised of all performances, information, and
                any changes that may occur, throughout the school year.
                
                RUHS Choirs are one of the finest choral music programs in the State of Arizona.
                During the year, regardless of the choir, members will experience many different
                types of music, learn more in the way of music theory, music history, and make
                some of the strongest friendships of their lives. The goal will be to learn, as a
                group, to share ideas, goals, and our love for music.
                <br>
                Here are some <strong>important dates</strong> to keep in mind this semester:
