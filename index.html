            This website was designed to assist you and your family to stay as
            informed and up-to-date with this yearâ€™s choir activities as possible. By using this
            website, it is our hope to keep you apprised of all performances, information, and
            any changes that may occur, throughout the school year.
            
            RUHS Choirs are one of the finest choral music programs in the State of Arizona.
            During the year, regardless of the choir, members will experience many different
            types of music, learn more in the way of music theory, music history, and make
            some of the strongest friendships of their lives. The goal will be to learn, as a
            group, to share ideas, goals, and our love for music.
